// #983's resolution, card 2 of 3. The **player** shape — a full-width heading, used for a person
// and nowhere else: name, then ONE status and ONE fee on a facts line, then the parts they play.
//
// ADR-0072 §2, and journey ②'s discriminator: someone holding a part in the ceremony solo AND the
// reception seven-piece is still one row here — one status, one fee, one confirmation, two part
// rows beneath. That is why this card is keyed by person and not by band.
//
// No per-person remove (#983): a player leaves by coming out of every part, and their row goes with
// the last one. `Players` is purely derived, which is what BookingBandMember being booking-scoped
// implies — a "remove from booking" button beside a "empty this part" button was two ✕ with
// different meanings on one person, which is most of what read as blurry.
