# ADR-0054 — Portal visibility is computed by a single authority, consumed by both the portal and the admin indicator

## Status
Accepted (2026-06-22; amended 2026-06-24 — final indicator treatment + a second companion fix for the cancelled-booking contract leak; amended 2026-07-02 — the music-form draft/published model ships, closing the gap this ADR reserved for #533; see below; amended 2026-08-18 — visibility gains an *audience* gate alongside its state gate, so a series invoice document is never portal-visible through a member booking's portal; see below; **amended 2026-08-19** — the authority gains an `audience: CLIENT | BAND` parameter, answering the question the 2026-08-18 amendment deliberately left open; see [ADR-0073](0073-band-portal-visibility-and-projection.md)). Builds on [ADR-0021](0021-contract-portal-visibility-driven-by-status.md) (contract visibility driven by status), [ADR-0031](0031-portal-visibility-driven-by-source-truth.md) (portal visibility driven by source truth, not checklist state), and [ADR-0042](0042-invoice-issued-state-decouple-issue-from-send.md) (invoice `Issued` vs `Sent`). Sliced into issues #578 (core), #579 (leak fixes), #580 (per-document rows).

## Context

The admin booking detail page gives the musician **no consistent signal of what the client can currently see** on the [[Portal]]. Portal visibility today is governed by scattered, concern-specific rules, each correct in isolation but with no unified surfacing (issue #534):

- **Contract** — the signing section is visible while `SENT`, replaced by the signed-PDF download once `contractSignedAt` is set (ADR-0021).
- **Invoices / Documents** — an `INVOICE` document appears on the portal only once its invoice is `Sent`/`Paid`; `Issued`-but-unsent and `Void` are retained but hidden (ADR-0031 / ADR-0042).
- **Music form** — visible the instant it is turned on (`hasMusicForm = !!musicFormConfig`); no draft period (#533).
- **Booking summary** — always visible.

The musician must *know all of these rules* to predict what the client is looking at — a question they ask constantly around sending invites, issuing invoices, and finalising the contract. The complaint #534 raises is fundamentally one of **legibility**: the truth exists, but only in the portal renderer's head.

The naïve fix — have each admin concern card re-derive "is this visible?" from the booking fields it already holds — recreates the exact problem one layer up: a **second, divergent copy** of the visibility rules. The day a portal rule changes (e.g. #533 re-gating the music form on `Published`), the admin indicator would silently lie. The whole point of #534 is to *stop* visibility logic from being scattered; duplicating it into the frontend would betray that goal.

This is also consistent with where ADR-0031 pointed: its "future direction" anticipated a unified visibility signal once richer multi-stakeholder portals arrive.

## Decision

**Portal visibility is computed by a single backend authority, and both the client portal and the admin "Portal visibility indicator" read their verdict from it.**

1. **One authority.** The per-concern visibility computation (today spread across `portal.service.ts` — `activeContract.status`, `isPortalVisibleDocument`, `!!musicFormConfig`, booking-`Cancelled` handling) is consolidated so there is a single function/module that answers "is concern X visible on the portal right now, and if not, why?". The existing portal rendering is refactored to consume it (no behaviour change to the portal).

2. **Two consumers, same truth.** The admin booking detail payload returns a **per-concern visibility map** computed by that same authority — `{ contract: { visible, reason? }, musicForm: { visible, reason? }, documents: [{ id, visible, reason? }] }`. The portal renderer and the admin indicator are then provably consistent: they cannot disagree because they share the computation.

3. **The indicator is a passive mirror.** It reports visibility; it never changes it. The concern's own actions (send, issue) remain the only way to alter visibility. (See the [[Portal visibility indicator]] glossary entry.)

### Shape of the signal

- **Asymmetric — a badge for visible, a quiet hint for hidden.** Visible → a green "**Visible on Client Portal**" badge (Lucide `Eye` + primary green, semibold). Hidden → a muted "**Not visible …**" hint (Lucide `EyeOff` + grey), naming the *portal* gate ("until sent", "— voided", "to client", "— cancelled") in portal terms — **not** communication history (the musician tracks their own sent mail; this signal is strictly about what the portal surface renders). The hint deliberately mirrors the badge's own word *visible*, so it inherits the "Client Portal" anchor without repeating it. The visible state is the prominent one (heightened awareness: "your client is looking at this now"); the hidden hint is subordinate.
- **Reason codes are retained** to drive the hint copy. The API stays display-agnostic — it returns a stable `ReasonCode`, never English — and the reason → copy map lives frontend-side.
- **Concerns are flagged where visibility is *non-obvious*.** The always-visible booking summary carries no indicator — its visibility is obvious, nothing to predict. A concern whose visibility is gated (contract, invoices) or *silently private among visible siblings* (an UPLOAD doc sitting in a documents list next to client-visible rows) **is** flagged, because the musician cannot tell at a glance. This both disambiguates "not a portal concern" (no flag) from "a portal concern currently hidden" (flag, hidden state), and reassures in the mixed-list case ("is my agent contract visible?!" — the exact anxiety #534 names).
- **Granularity follows the concern.** Singletons (contract, music form) → one card-level indicator. Lists (invoice / document rows) → one indicator **per row**, because each document is gated independently.

### Per-concern mapping

| Concern | State | Indicator |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | booking CANCELLED (any contract state) | Not visible — cancelled *(outermost gate)* |
| Contract | DRAFT | Not visible until sent |
| Contract | SENT / SIGNED | Visible on Client Portal |
| Contract | VOID | Not visible — voided |
| Music form | published (config exists, `publishedAt` set) | Visible on Client Portal |
| Music form | draft (config exists, `publishedAt` null) | Not visible until published |
| Music form | off (no config) | (no indicator) |
| INVOICE doc | Sent / Paid | Visible on Client Portal |
| INVOICE doc | Issued (unsent) | Not visible until sent |
| INVOICE doc | Void | Not visible — voided |
| CONTRACT doc | signed, active contract | Visible on Client Portal |
| CONTRACT doc | superseded (its contract VOID) | Not visible — voided |
| SONG_LIST doc | — | Visible on Client Portal |
| UPLOAD doc | — | Not visible to client |

Booking `CANCELLED` is the **outermost** gate on the contract concern — it takes precedence over the contract's own state, so a cancelled booking's contract always reads "Not visible — cancelled". The signed-contract PDF is badged in **two** places (ContractCard + its document row); both are true, describing two surfaces.

### Companion fixes: two portal leaks the authority closes

Consolidating the scattered rules surfaces two pre-existing leaks. Both are deliberate behaviour changes, closed by routing the portal through the authority, and bundled into a single slice (issue #579):

**UPLOAD documents.** `isPortalVisibleDocument` currently ends in `return true`, and the portal document query (`portal.repository.ts`) loads `documents` with **no `where` filter on type** — so **UPLOAD documents are shown on the portal today** (the upload feature is built; the `as 'CONTRACT' | 'INVOICE' | 'SONG_LIST'` cast in the portal documents mapping is a compile-time fiction masking the UPLOAD case). A musician uploading an agent contract exposes it to the client, contradicting CONTEXT's description of UPLOADs as private paperwork. UPLOADs become never client-visible (per-document client sharing is a possible future feature, not current behaviour).

**Cancelled-booking contract.** Cancelling a booking only sets `status = CANCELLED` — it does **not** void the contract — and the portal renders the signing CTA whenever the contract is `SENT`, with no booking-status check. So **a client can currently sign the contract for a cancelled gig.** CONTEXT already (falsely) claimed signing was hidden on cancelled bookings; this makes that true. The fix makes booking-`CANCELLED` the **outermost** gate on the contract concern: the portal suppresses the signing CTA, the signed-contract download, **and** the contract document row on a cancelled booking. Scope is **contract-only** — invoice documents keep their existing gate (a cancelled gig may still carry a legitimately-owed cancellation-fee invoice the client must pay) and the always-visible booking summary is unchanged. This deliberately reverses the prior behaviour where a signed-contract download remained visible on a cancelled booking (CONTEXT's "Cancelled bookings" entry is updated to match).

### Surface and rendering

- **Detail page only** for now (not the create form — no portal exists pre-creation; not the Builder edit surface — the question "what can my client see?" is a read-surface question).
- A single new shared component, **`components/common/PortalVisibility`**, is the only rendering home — guaranteeing the cross-concern consistency #534 demands. Treatment (settled via prototype): **icon + coloured text, never a chip or enclosure, and no new palette hue.** A tinted/bordered chip would mimic the status pill and collapse the two axes, so the `Eye`/`EyeOff` icon is the axis differentiator and colour only signals how prominent "visible" is. Visible = green `Eye` + "Visible on Client Portal"; hidden = muted `EyeOff` + "Not visible …". A reserved new accent hue and an enclosing pill were both prototyped and rejected — they read as "just another status" beside the existing status pills.

## Consequences

- **Legibility without coupling.** The musician sees portal state at a glance; the checklist↔portal coupling ADR-0031 rejected is not reintroduced (the indicator reads source truth, not checklist state).
- **#533 lands in one place.** The music-form draft/published model (amendment below) changed only the authority's music-form gate; both the portal and the indicator picked it up with **no #534 rework** — the seam this ADR predicted, exercised.
- **Two pre-existing leaks are closed** — UPLOAD documents, and the cancelled-booking contract (a client could previously sign a cancelled gig's contract).
- **The hidden state is a quiet hint, not a badge.** The earlier worry that flagging hidden concerns adds chrome is resolved by making the hidden state deliberately subordinate (muted `EyeOff` + short "Not visible …") while only the *visible* state is a prominent badge. This keeps the predictive "until sent" value at low visual cost. A faithful per-booking portal *preview* (#531) remains the complementary "see exactly" answer to this indicator's "know at a glance".

## Alternatives considered

- **Re-derive visibility in each admin card.** Cheapest; guarantees divergence from the portal renderer the first time a rule changes. Rejected — it re-scatters the very logic #534 exists to consolidate.
- **Admin reads the portal endpoint (`?preview=admin`) for truth.** Conceptually one source, but couples the admin detail page to the portal token/endpoint and returns client-shaped data the admin UI must re-map. Awkward; rejected.
- **Three-state lifecycle (Not started / Prepared-not-shared / Visible) on every concern.** Over-modelled — most concerns are genuinely binary; the only real "prepared but not shared" state is the music form (see the #533 amendment below). The positive-badge-plus-muted-hint shape carries that nuance in the hint string instead.
- **Visible-only badge (no hidden hint at all).** Considered: drop the hidden state entirely so absence-of-badge means "not visible". Rejected because it loses the predictive "until sent" value — a `DRAFT` contract would look identical to a non-portal concern — and weakens the "is my agent contract visible?!" reassurance. The muted hint restores both at low chrome cost.

## Amendment (2026-07-02) — music-form draft → published (#533)

Reverses the earlier decision (CONTEXT's `MusicFormConfig` entry) that a turned-on form is *"independent of the send-invite action — the form may be on before the invite is sent"* and visible the instant it exists (`hasMusicForm = !!musicFormConfig`).

**The problem.** `Save` *was* `publish`: turning the form on made it immediately client-visible, so a freshly-seeded, default, mid-edit form was already fillable by the client. There was no draft period in which the musician could prepare it privately — the one concern in the app without a prepare-then-publish flow (contrast contracts, invisible until `SENT`, and invoices, invisible until `Sent`).

**The model — mirrors invoices.** `MusicFormConfig` gains a nullable `publishedAt`. Three states: **Off** (no config → no portal concern, no indicator), **Draft** (`publishedAt` null → hidden, indicator "Not visible until published"), **Published** (`publishedAt` set → visible). New forms are **draft by default**. Publishing is a **soft, reversible** act (draft ⇄ published at any time; edits stay live once published — no content lock, unlike a committed invoice).

**Send is gated on publish, not the reverse.** Publish is a prerequisite for sending the invite — mirroring the invoice ordering (you can no more email an invite for an unpublished form than `Send` an un-`Issued` invoice). The `gather_song_requests` [[Goal]] carries the order: `set_up_and_publish` (MILESTONE, auto-completes on `publishedAt` being set; reverts on un-publish) → `add_email_music` (PRECONDITION, gates only the invite step, not publication — publishing needs no client email) → `music_form_invite` → `song_requests`.

**One gate, two enforcement points.** Publication is enforced at the checklist/UI (the invite step isn't actionable, and the Send-Email dialog disables the `music_form_invite` template, until published) **and** at the API — sending a `music_form_invite` communication for an unpublished form is rejected. The portal's music-form data and submission endpoints (`getMusicFormData`, `POST /booking/:token/music`) gate on published too, not just the link — a token holder cannot fetch or submit a draft form directly. Same class of leak as the cancelled-contract fix above: the render gate and the action gate must agree.

**Authority change is the whole backend surface.** `resolveMusicFormVisibility(hasConfig, isPublished)` gains its middle branch → reason code `until_published` (copy: "Not visible until published", mirroring the contract's "until sent"). Both consumers (the portal's `hasMusicForm` and the admin indicator) pass `config?.publishedAt != null`; nothing else in the visibility logic moves — the seam this ADR promised.

**UI.** The music-form config sheet gets Save draft / Publish actions (the invoice sheet pattern); on publish, the send-invite email sheet opens automatically (mirroring invoice issue → send chaining).

**Migration.** Existing `MusicFormConfig` rows were backfilled `publishedAt = createdAt` inside the run-once Prisma migration, so already-visible forms stayed visible — no client saw the form vanish. Only forms created after deploy started draft.

**Why still one ADR, not a new one.** The draft/published shape is a genuine reversal, but it lands entirely inside the authority this ADR established and exercises the seam this ADR predicted ("#533 lands in one place"). Amending keeps the visibility story in one file; ADR-0031's source-truth principle is extended (visibility = published state), not overturned.

## Amendment (2026-08-18) — a document's audience, not just its state

Series invoicing forced a distinction the original authority does not make. `resolveDocumentVisibility` answers *"is this document ready to be seen?"* purely from its own state — an `INVOICE` document is portal-visible once its invoice is `Sent` or `Paid`. That is sufficient while every document belongs to exactly one booking, because "the client" is unambiguous: the booking's customer.

A [[BookingSeries]] invoice breaks the assumption. Its `Document` has `bookingId: null`, and it is addressed to the **series** customer — who, per CONTEXT.md's Membership rules, may differ from any given member booking's own `customerId` (series assignment deliberately never modifies the booking's customer). Its line items itemise *every* member booking's date and fee.

So when the series invoice document becomes discoverable from each member booking's Documents card (see below), state-based visibility alone would expose one client's billing — and the fees of every other date in the series — on another client's portal.

**Amended rule.** Visibility has two gates, and both must pass:

1. **State** — unchanged: the existing `resolveDocumentVisibility` verdict.
2. **Audience** — a document is portal-visible through a booking's portal only if that booking is its owner. A series invoice document is owned by no booking, so it is **never** portal-visible through a member booking's portal, at any invoice status.

The audience gate is expressed **in the authority**, not by relying on the admin and portal reads happening to use different queries. Today the portal reads the `booking.documents` relation while the admin card reads `findByBooking`, so unioning the series document into the admin read would not in fact leak — but a leak prevented by an accident of query shape is exactly what "a single authority, so the two cannot disagree" exists to rule out. The next person to unify those reads must not be able to reintroduce this.

**Not settled here:** whether a series should have a client-facing surface of its own, addressed to the series customer, on which its invoice *would* legitimately be visible. That is the audience-aware visibility question #816 opens, and this amendment deliberately closes only the leak, not the question.


## Amendment (2026-08-19) — the authority gains an `audience` parameter

The 2026-08-18 amendment above closed the series-invoice leak and explicitly left the wider question open: *"whether a series should have a client-facing surface of its own… That is the audience-aware visibility question #816 opens."*

[#816](https://github.com/thstanton/gigloop/issues/816) answered it for a different second audience — the dep, at `/band/:token`. **[ADR-0073](0073-band-portal-visibility-and-projection.md) holds the decision**; this amendment records its effect on *this* ADR:

**The authority takes an `audience: CLIENT | BAND` parameter.** Same pure module, same two-consumers-one-truth guarantee, one more argument. A second authority for the band portal was rejected as exactly the duplication this ADR exists to prevent, one audience later.

⚠️ **Two different things are now called "audience", and they are orthogonal.**

| Gate | Question | Added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ownership** (2026-08-18) | Does this booking own the document being asked about? | this ADR |
| **Audience** (2026-08-19) | Who is asking — the client, or a band member? | ADR-0073 |

A series invoice document is ownership-excluded from every booking portal *regardless of who looks*. The 2026-08-18 gate is unchanged and remains correct; the word is simply doing two jobs. Implementers should read the older gate as **ownership**.

**Consequence for existing call sites:** every current caller must pass `CLIENT` explicitly, which makes the previously-implicit audience visible at each site. That is mechanical, and it is the point.

**Not settled here:** a client-facing surface for a *series*, addressed to the series customer. Still open, still not this.
